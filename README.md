# Sen For Kotlin

#### Introduction

-   `Sen` is a cross-platform project that summarizes the programming knowledge of [Haruma] (https://github.com/Haruma-VN). According to him, it's a project that helps people solve difficult problems.
-   `Sen` was originally written as [Sen] (https://github.com/Haruma-VN/Sen), and this project is a Kotlin translation of his project.

#### Open Source Protocol

-   Since the source project uses the GPL-3.0 license, this project still uses the GPL-3.0 license.

#### Other Notes

-   Thanks to [Haruma] (https://github.com/Haruma-VN) for allowing me to master his project to create a runtime for the JVM, not just `C#`, `C++` and `Python`.
-   Because `C#` and `C++` are very flexible in terms of data transformation, and Kotlin is still rigid despite its strict restrictions on data types, I can't guarantee that all data transformations will work as expected, please evaluate before using them.
-   The project is built using JDK-21 and it is recommended to use the Oracle distribution.
